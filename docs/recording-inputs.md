# Recording inputs

Each source assignment chooses whether its input is recorded on its own,
beside the program recording:

```
POST /api/v1/productions/:id/sources   { "sourceId": "Whip", "mixerInput": "video_in_1", "record": "transcode" }
```

| `record` | |
| --- | --- |
| `off` (default) | Not recorded. |
| `transcode` | Decoded and re-encoded into the recorder. |
| `passthrough` | Encoded streams straight into the recorder. Not built yet: the route answers 400. |

Recording is off unless the assignment opts in: the feed may already be
recorded upstream (it came through a recording pre-router, say), and in a
delayed production the mixer inputs are bridged out of the store, where
recording them again would duplicate them. Like every other flow setting it
is read at activation, so a change takes effect on the next activation.
Assigning a source again replaces the whole assignment, so a request without
`record` turns recording off.

Only arriving feeds (WHIP, SRT, EFP) can be recorded this way. An assignment
of a test pattern, HTML source or clip that asks for it, or one that carries
`passthrough` from before the route refused it, is skipped with an
`input-recording-incomplete` activation warning. The program recording is
still set up by assigning a `recording` output, independently of this
setting.

## What is recorded

Each recorder taps its input before the `time_offset` blocks, so it holds the
feed as it arrived, with no lipsync trim applied. The trims are pad offsets on
running time, so a trim changed mid-show would make the recording's timestamps
jump.

`transcode` takes the decoded picture and sound through `builtin.videoenc`
(H.264, a keyframe every 60 frames, which is 2 s at the 30 fps browsers send)
and `builtin.audioenc` (AAC). It is the mode for WHIP feeds, because browser
H.264 has irregular keyframes and a keyframe request cannot reach the browser
through Strom's WHIP session bridge. It works for SRT/EFP too, at the cost of a
software encode per input on the Strom host. `passthrough`, for SRT/EFP
encoders with a fixed GOP, will record their encoded streams without decoding.

Picture and sound go to separate recorders, and so to separate files, because
an input can carry only one of them: a guest who joins with audio only, or a
camera or encoder that sends no sound. A recorder with both tracks waits for
both before it writes anything, so such an input would not be recorded at all,
and in testing the stalled recorder also stopped another input's recorder. With
one recorder per track, the missing track's recorder stays idle and writes no
file.

The two files line up by their start times in `recordings.json` (below).

Each recording branch starts with a leaky queue, so a slow encoder or a
stalled recorder drops frames from the recording instead of holding up the
input's feed to the mixers.

If Strom lacks `builtin.audioenc` or `builtin.videoenc`, inputs are recorded
without that track. Without `builtin.recorder`, or without both encoders, they
are not recorded. Each case adds an `input-recording-incomplete` activation
warning, which the controller shows as an `ERROR` frame.

## Where the files go

```
recordings/<productionId>/<activation>/              program recording, recordings.json
recordings/<productionId>/<activation>/video_in_N/   <productionId>_video_in_N_{video,audio}_<timestamp>_<n>.mp4
```

`<activation>` is the activation's start time plus a uuid. On deactivate, with
object storage configured, every recorder is split, the flow is stopped once
each split has opened its next file, and the files are uploaded like the
program's: object key `<RECORDING_KEY_PREFIX><productionId>/<file>`,
one `RecordingDoc` each, with `mixerInput` and `track` set for an input's file. Without
object storage the files stay on Strom.

## `recordings.json`

Open Live writes a sidecar into each activation's directory, rewrites it after
each recorder event, and writes it a last time on deactivate. With object
storage it is copied to `<RECORDING_KEY_PREFIX><productionId>/<activation>/recordings.json`
and is not listed as a recording.

    }
  }
}
```

A recorder opens its file on its first buffer, so for a WHIP input its first
file starts when the guest's media first arrived, not when the flow started.

`startMs` is the file's t=0 on Strom's pipeline clock, mapped to UTC
milliseconds (fractional), as Strom reports it in `RecorderFileChanged`. A
moment at wall-clock time `T` is at `T - startMs` into the file, and the same
moment has the same `startMs + t` in every file of the activation, so an
input's video and audio files line up exactly. It is absent when Strom does
not report it (Strom before Eyevinn/strom#944).

`openedAtMs` is when Open Live received the event. Without `startMs` it is the
only start time, and it is late by the event's delivery and the encoder's
start-up delay. These differ between an input's video and audio files: in a
200 s test with a file split every 20 s, files lined up this way were 50 ms
early to 15 ms late (WHIP) and 50 to 80 ms late (SRT) against one two-track
file of the same input.

`guests` lists the guest sessions on that input during the activation, from
their session documents: `joinedAt` is the session's creation and `leftAt` its
last update once it has left.

Not listed: a file opened while Open Live was not connected to Strom's event
stream.

The final split at deactivate leaves each recorder a last file of a few
milliseconds, listed like any other. Strom's stop does not finalise it, so it
may hold one frame or no media at all; skip a file you cannot read.

## For tools that read these recordings

A separate writer (a TAMS store, for one) can pick the recordings up from the
layout above without asking Open Live:

- Every activation that records anything has its own directory, and its
  `recordings.json` sits at the top of it. Input files are only ever in that
  directory's `video_in_N/` subdirectories, one per recorded input.
- Each file holds one track; `track` in its `RecordingDoc`, and the
  `{video,audio}` part of its name, say which.
- `inputs` in `recordings.json` is keyed by `mixerInput` and gives the source
  (`sourceId`, `sourceName`, `streamType`), the guests on it, and
  `recordMode`.
- Each file's `startMs` is the UTC time its timeline starts at, exact across
  files of the same activation; `openedAtMs` stands in, less exactly, when
  `startMs` is absent.
- `version` changes if a field is renamed or removed; new fields may be added
  without a change.
