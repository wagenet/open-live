 * the current `block_health` list on GET /api/flows/:id. This maps a
 * production's guest input blocks to their guest seats and turns those reports
 * into `GUEST_HEALTH` controller messages. The meter relay feeds it live events
 * (it already holds the production's Strom WS); the controller connect snapshot
 * feeds it the flow's `block_health`, so a reconnecting studio sees a failure
 * that is still going on.
