# open-live

Open Live is a cloud-native live broadcast production suite that replaces traditional hardware — vision mixers, audio consoles, and multiviewers — with a fully browser-based solution. This repository is the central API server. The browser-based production controller lives in [open-live-studio](https://github.com/Eyevinn/open-live-studio).

## Try it on OSC

The fastest way to try Open Live — no Kubernetes required.

Visit **[openlive.apps.osaas.io](https://openlive.apps.osaas.io)** to spin up a managed Open Live instance on Open Source Cloud. Start for an event, tear down after. No infrastructure to manage and no monthly minimum.

- 14-day free trial, free plan available
- 15 EUR/month (self-hosted Strom) or 69 EUR/month (shared GPU in Frankfurt — **demo purposes
  only**; the Frankfurt GPU is shared between all users on this plan, capacity is not guaranteed
  and performance varies with load, so it is not suitable for live production)
- For guaranteed capacity and live production, add a **Hosted GPU** add-on (from 750 EUR/month) —
  see the pricing card on [openlive.apps.osaas.io](https://openlive.apps.osaas.io)

The in-app **Create New Open Live** flow provisions CouchDB for you and generates its admin
password automatically. You do not choose or handle that password yourself on this path.
The `COUCHDB_URL` environment variable documented under [Configuration](#configuration)
below is only for a self-hosted deployment where you run CouchDB yourself; it does not apply
to the managed OSC flow above.

**Before you start, two things that are not obvious from the pricing line above:**

- **Shared Strom (the 69 EUR/month option) requires the Professional plan or above.** If your
  account is not eligible, the app shows this up front when you open the environment, not as a
  failed submission after you try to create one.
- **Your own ("BYO") Strom instance has no plan requirement, but its URL must be publicly
  reachable.** A plain local-network or loopback address is rejected, and so is any address
  that is not reachable from OSC, including a plain Tailscale or other mesh-VPN address in the
  `100.64.0.0/10` range even though it clears the initial check. To expose a locally hosted
  Strom instance without port-forwarding, use a public ingress feature such as
  [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) (opt-in, off by default; also
  implemented by self-hosted [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale)), which gives
  the instance a genuinely public `ts.net` hostname. On the free plan this path is metered by
  your one-time token allowance rather than gated by plan, so budget for that if you are
  testing rather than running on a paid plan.

## Features

- **Vision mixing** — cuts, auto transitions, DSK layers, picture-in-picture, graphics overlays, and fade-to-black
- **Graphics** — HTML/image overlays keyed onto the programme via DSK, including [OGraf](https://github.com/ebu/ograf) (EBU HTML-graphics spec) templates; see the [graphics guide](docs/graphics.md)
- **Audio mixer** — per-channel faders with EBU R128 loudness metering
- **Multiviewer** — sub-500ms WebRTC glass-to-glass latency
- **Stream Deck control** — hardware button panel integration
- **Up to 16 sources** per production
- **REMI / remote production** — crews work from anywhere via browser; eliminates travel and equipment shipping
- **Self-hostable** on any Kubernetes cluster, zero vendor lock-in

## Running it yourself

This repository is the API server. On its own it exposes a REST API and a WebSocket
channel — to actually cut a show you also need the two pieces below.

**What you need**

- Node.js 22 and pnpm 10.33+
- A **CouchDB** instance (local or remote) — all productions, sources and config live here
- A **Strom** instance — the GStreamer engine that does the real work: mixing video and
  audio, compositing graphics, and encoding the programme and multiview outputs. Open Live
  drives it over its REST and WebSocket APIs and never touches media itself. Run one
  locally with Docker, or point at an existing instance. See the
  [Strom setup guide](https://github.com/EyevinnOSC/community/wiki/User-Guide:-Open-Live-Setup#strom).
- [open-live-studio](https://github.com/Eyevinn/open-live-studio) — the browser UI. Without
  it you have an API and no controls.

**Quickstart**

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

The minimum to get a server running locally:

```env
COUCHDB_URL=http://admin:password@localhost:5984
STROM_URL=http://localhost:8080
API_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

Then start it, and point the studio at it:

```bash
pnpm dev                                  # this server, on http://localhost:3000
# in open-live-studio: OPEN_LIVE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Create the `open-live` database in CouchDB before first start. Everything else in
[Configuration](#configuration) is optional for local development — but read
[Operating in production](#operating-in-production) before exposing this to a network.

**Commands**

```bash
pnpm dev          # development server with hot reload
pnpm typecheck    # type-check without emitting
pnpm build        # compile TypeScript to dist/
pnpm start        # run the compiled server
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
and fill in the values:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | Port the server listens on | `3000` |
| `COUCHDB_URL` | Full CouchDB connection URL. Credentials may be embedded, or supplied via `COUCHDB_USER`/`COUCHDB_PASSWORD` | required |
| `COUCHDB_USER` | CouchDB username, injected into `COUCHDB_URL` at startup when the URL has no embedded credentials (only applied if `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` is also set) | _(empty)_ |
| `COUCHDB_PASSWORD` | CouchDB password, injected into `COUCHDB_URL` at startup when the URL has no embedded credentials | _(empty)_ |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Allowed CORS origin(s): a single origin, a comma-separated list, or `*` for wildcard. **When unset, cross-origin requests are disabled** (`origin: false`) and a `[security]` warning is logged — there is no default origin | _(empty — cross-origin disabled)_ |
| `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | Externally reachable base URL of this service, used to build WHIP callback URLs. **Required in production** (`NODE_ENV=production`): the server refuses to start without it, because otherwise WHIP URLs are derived from the `X-Forwarded-Host` header, enabling host-header injection. Outside production, logs a warning and falls back to request-derived URLs | _(empty)_ |
| `TRUSTED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated allow-list of hostnames permitted when building request-derived WHIP URLs (used only when `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is unset). A request whose derived host is not on this list is rejected rather than persisted | _(empty)_ |
| `STROM_URL` | Base URL of the Strom pipeline engine | `http://localhost:7000` |
| `SRT_PUBLIC_HOST` | Public hostname on which the shared Strom instance's SRT listener ports are reachable from external SRT callers. Used to build the read-only `connect` dial-in address surfaced on `mpegtssrt`/`efpsrt` outputs (`GET /api/v1/outputs`). When unset, the host is derived from the `STROM_URL` hostname; if that is loopback/private the `connect.uri` is returned as `null` with a `reason` rather than a misleading address. Set this when the SRT port is published on a different public host than the HTTP API (e.g. NATed / shared-GPU topologies) | _(empty — derived from `STROM_URL`)_ |
| `STROM_AUTH_TOKEN` | Token for authenticating against Strom. See [Strom authentication](#strom-authentication) below. `STROM_TOKEN` is accepted as a legacy fallback | _(empty — not needed for local Strom)_ |
| `STROM_AUTH_MODE` | How `STROM_AUTH_TOKEN` is used: `osc` exchanges an OSC Personal Access Token for a short-lived SAT (OSC-hosted Strom); `direct` sends the token as a Bearer key (self-hosted / non-OSC Strom) | `osc` |
| `API_KEY` | Static API key protecting all `/api/v1` routes, the WebSocket controller, and the Swagger UI. **Required for any network-accessible deployment** (see below) | _(empty — routes unauthenticated)_ |
| `TRUST_EXTERNAL_AUTH` | Acknowledges that `API_KEY` is intentionally unset because another layer (e.g. OSC's reverse proxy) handles auth instead. See below | `false` |
| `SRT_PASSPHRASE_KEY` | AES-256 key (32 bytes, base64 or hex) that encrypts SRT source passphrases at rest. **Fails closed in production**: the encrypt/decrypt path throws if it is unset (or malformed) when a passphrase must be processed. Unset in non-production stores passphrases in plaintext with a warning. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` | _(empty)_ |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Fastify log level (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) | `info` |
| `STROM_PORT_LEASE_SIZE` | Number of SRT listener ports to reserve from a shared Strom — see [`docs/port-reservation.md`](docs/port-reservation.md) | `10` |
| `STROM_PORT_LEASE_CLIENT_ID` | Stable owner id sent to Strom | hostname of `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, else `open-live-<hostname>` |
| `STROM_PORT_LEASE_DISABLED` | Set to `true` to turn off port reservation | `false` |
| `IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | Seconds a production may have zero connected clients before it is auto-deactivated (`endedReason: 'idle'`). A `KEEP_ALIVE` from any client resets this timer | `300` |
| `IDLE_WARNING_LEAD_SEC` | Lead time before the idle deadline at which the backend emits a single `IDLE_WARNING` (with `remainingSec` + `deadlineMs`) over the controller WS so clients can keep the show up. Clamped to `IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` | `60` |
| `GUEST_INVITE_SECRET` | **Optional override** for the HMAC key that signs production-scoped guest invite tokens. Guest calling is **on by default** (issue #391): when this is unset the backend generates a signing key on first start and stores it in its own CouchDB, reusing it on every restart. Set this only to pin a specific key (e.g. a pre-existing self-hosted deployment); if set it wins over the stored key. Only the SHA-256 hash of each token is persisted; the raw token is returned once and never stored. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` | _(empty — backend auto-generates and stores a key)_ |
| `GUEST_INVITE_TTL_S` | Default guest invite lifetime in seconds (invites stay short-lived on purpose) | `86400` |
| `INTERCOM_MANAGER_URL` | Base URL of the Open Intercom manager ([`Eyevinn/intercom-manager`](https://github.com/Eyevinn/intercom-manager)) for operator↔guest talkback. Optional: when unset, guest calling still works with WHIP video + WHEP return but no talkback line | _(empty — talkback disabled)_ |
| `INTERCOM_MANAGER_TOKEN` | Auth token for the Open Intercom manager. Optional; held server-side only and redacted from logs | _(empty)_ |

> **Never commit `.env`** — it is gitignored. Use `.env.example` as the reference.

## API

The REST API is documented in [`docs/openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi.yaml) and served as
interactive Swagger UI at **`/documentation`**. That is the authoritative reference — the
list below is a map of what exists, not a complete signature listing.

| Area | Routes |
|---|---|
| Health | `/health`, `/healthz` (OSC probe alias), `/ready` (requires CouchDB) |
| Service status | `/api/v1/status`, `/api/v1/ping`, `/api/v1/server-info`, `POST /api/v1/reconnect` |
| Productions | `/api/v1/productions`, `/api/v1/productions/:id`, plus `:id/activate` and `:id/deactivate` |
| Production contents | `:id/sources`, `:id/outputs`, `:id/graphics`, `:id/macros`, `:id/whip/:mixerInput` |
| Production runtime | `:id/pipeline`, `:id/audio`, `:id/stats/streaming`, `:id/controllers` |
| Resources | `/api/v1/sources`, `/api/v1/outputs`, `/api/v1/graphics`, `/api/v1/production-configs` |
| WebRTC | `/api/v1/ice-servers`, `/api/v1/whep-proxy` |
| WebSocket | `/ws/productions/:id/controller` — the controller channel |

The WebSocket controller channel — its authentication, inbound message types, and outbound
broadcasts — is documented separately in [`docs/controller-websocket.md`](docs/controller-websocket.md).

### Source model

Sources represent individual video/audio feeds. Each source has a `streamType` — `srt`, `efp`, `whip`, `html`, or the built-in test patterns `test1` / `test2` — and an `address` (SRT URI, WHIP endpoint URL, or page URL for `html`). The test-pattern types need no address and are useful for bringing a production up without any ingest.

SRT passphrases are embedded in the source `address` and encrypted at rest before being stored in CouchDB. For rotating a passphrase or responding to a suspected compromise, see the operator runbook in [`docs/srt-passphrase-rotation.md`](docs/srt-passphrase-rotation.md).

### Activation flow

1. A production is given source assignments (`POST /api/v1/productions/:id/sources`), plus any outputs and graphics.
2. `POST /api/v1/productions/:id/activate` builds a Strom flow from the built-in topology in [`src/lib/default-flow.ts`](src/lib/default-flow.ts) — vision mixer, audio mixer, encoders and WHEP endpoints sized to the production's config — patches each assigned source's address into the matching block, then creates and starts the flow in Strom. The `stromFlowId` is stored on the production.
3. `POST /api/v1/productions/:id/deactivate` stops and deletes the Strom flow and clears `stromFlowId`.

The flow topology is generated, not user-supplied: productions are configured through their sources, outputs, graphics and config values rather than by editing flow JSON.

### Graphics

Graphics are HTML or image overlays rendered by the pipeline and keyed onto the programme
output through a downstream keyer (DSK). This supports standards-based HTML templates such as
[OGraf](https://github.com/ebu/ograf) (the EBU spec, authored with the
[OGraf Template Editor](https://github.com/Eyevinn/ograf-editor)). See the end-to-end
[**Graphics in Open Live** guide](docs/graphics.md) for authoring, registering, assigning to a
DSK, and taking graphics on air — including an honest note on what is not yet integrated
(e.g. the SPX graphics controller).

## Operating in production

The defaults are tuned for local development. Before this service is reachable from a
network, both of the following apply.

### API authentication

All `/api/v1` routes, the WebSocket controller (`/ws/`), and the Swagger UI
(`/documentation`) are protected by a static API key when `API_KEY` is set. Clients
must send it as a bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

Browser WebSocket clients cannot set custom headers, so they carry the key through the
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header instead: offer the two sentinel subprotocols
`openlive.bearer` and `openlive.bearer.<API_KEY>` via `new WebSocket(url, protocols)`.
The server extracts the key from the second (`extractSubprotocolKey()`) and echoes back
only the plain `openlive.bearer` marker, keeping the secret out of the request URL and
access logs. The `?key=<API_KEY>` query parameter is **not** accepted — it was removed
in #49 because it leaks the key into proxy/CDN/DevTools logs. See
[`docs/controller-websocket.md`](docs/controller-websocket.md) for details.

> **`API_KEY` must be set for any network-accessible deployment.** When `API_KEY` is
> unset, every API route is unauthenticated — any client that can reach the service can
> create, modify, delete, and activate productions. The server **refuses to start** when
> `NODE_ENV=production` and `API_KEY` is unset, unless `TRUST_EXTERNAL_AUTH=true`
> acknowledges that a trusted external auth layer (e.g. the OSC reverse proxy) is handling
> it instead — `NODE_ENV` reflects the deployment tier, not the auth architecture, so it
> can't be used as that signal by itself. Outside production it logs a prominent warning
> instead of refusing to start. The reference `docker-compose.yml` requires `API_KEY` to
> be set in your `.env` before the stack will start — generate a strong random value with
> `openssl rand -base64 32`.

### Strom authentication

Strom authentication is configured with `STROM_AUTH_TOKEN` and `STROM_AUTH_MODE`.
(`STROM_TOKEN` is still read as a legacy fallback for `STROM_AUTH_TOKEN`, but new
deployments should use `STROM_AUTH_TOKEN`.)

- **`STROM_AUTH_MODE=osc`** (the default) — for a Strom instance behind OSC authentication. Set
  `STROM_AUTH_TOKEN` to your OSC Personal Access Token; the server automatically
  exchanges it for a short-lived Service Access Token (SAT) and refreshes it before
  expiry. No extra steps needed. Note that an `eyevinn-strom` instance from the OSC
  catalogue is not a supported backend — see [OSC deployment](#osc-deployment).
- **`STROM_AUTH_MODE=direct`** — for the shared Eyevinn instance and any self-hosted
  Strom. `STROM_AUTH_TOKEN` is sent directly as the `Authorization: Bearer` token with
  no exchange step.

Leave `STROM_AUTH_TOKEN` unset when running Strom locally without authentication.

## OSC deployment

The app is deployed on [Open Source Cloud](https://www.osaas.io). Environment variables are injected at runtime via an OSC parameter store — no `.env` file is needed on the server.

Required services: CouchDB (`apache-couchdb`), parameter store (`eyevinn-app-config-svc` + `valkey`).

Strom is **not** deployed as an OSC service instance. `STROM_URL` points at a GPU host outside the OSC catalogue (the shared Eyevinn instance, or your own) — see [Strom authentication](#strom-authentication) above. The `eyevinn-strom` catalogue service is not a supported backend.
